This is a repository I created to practice gitops. *This is also my first time using markdown.*

## Other Repositories

I plan on creating other repositories for the following:

- Powershell Scripts
- Bash Scripts
- Python Scripts

## Current Goal

I plan on making a contribution on GitHub at leaset once a day for a year, no matter how small.
